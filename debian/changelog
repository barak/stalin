stalin (0.11-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Turn off optimization on amd64 in order to be able to build within 2GB
    (hopefully).  (closes: #404734)

  * Fix support for GNU/kFreeBSD.  Thanks to Petr Salinger.
    (closes: #410810)

stalin (0.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add kfreebsd-i386 and kfreebsd-amd64 to the architectures list.
    (closes: #314857)

  * Add real package alternatives for all of the virtual build
    dependencies.  (closes: #409450)

  * Use stalin's internal copy of libgc for now.  Debian's doesn't build
    with the same options (gc-Makefile.sed) and runs out of RAM during a
    bootstrap build.

  * Try using -O1 on amd64 to reduce memory usage.  Apparently -O2
    wouldn't build on a 2GB machine (see bug #404734).

stalin (0.11-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Migrate to a new upstream release; This should resolve the licensing
    issues with the opengl/xlib bindings. (closes: #375943)

  * Remove dependency on gcc-3.4.  The bug in gcc-4.1 has been fixed, and
    gcc-4.0 should work correctly as well.

  * Add dependencies on dpkg-dev; stalin-architecture-name uses it now.

  * Add support for ia64 and amd64.

  * Generate new precompiled C source for all architectures. (closes: #337169)

  * Drop support for m68k and arm since, if nothing else, their buildds
    don't have enough RAM.  For the same reason, don't add powerpc.
    (closes: #271836, #273130)

  * Change xlibs-dev dependency to libx11-dev. (closes: #347053)

  * Add build-time support for selection of scheme compiler,
    i.e. "stalin=./stalin ./build"

  * Change upstream gcc -O3 to -O2; -O3 requires much more RAM.

  * Generalize makefile architecture support (i.e. stalin-arch-%.c) and
    add all-precompiled-srcs target.

  * Test the build by running some benchmarks afterward.

  * Invoke benchmarks/make-clean from "make clean".

  * Drop stalin-wrapper; stalin itself handles things now.

stalin (0.9+0.10alpha2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Migrate to quilt.

  * Fix problem where bootstrap required . to be in PATH.  Thanks to
    Christopher Cramer.  (closes: #336502)
    - debian/patches/misc.diff.
  
  * Rebuild against newer libgc.  (closes: #320972, #324498)

  * Build-Depend on and build with gcc-3.4 for now.  A gcc-4.0 build goes
    off into an infinite loop at the moment.  The compiler can now be
    selected via the CC environment variable.
    - debian/patches/allow-compiler-selection.diff
    - debian/control
    - debian/rules

  * Add simple after-build sanity checks.

stalin (0.9+0.10alpha2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New release (0.10alpha2) that the upstream author has requested we use
    in place of 0.9.
  * Save space by just making symbolic links for several platforms that
    need the same C code as stalin-IA32.c.  (closes: #231602)
    - debian/rules
  * Remove alpha from Architecture since it was never supposed to be there
    and the package is known (upstream) not to work there yet.  (closes:
    #216341).
    - debian/control

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org>  Tue, 17 Aug 2004 17:05:12 -0500

  * New upstream version.
  * Updated to latest upstream release. (closes: #97884)
  * Presumed stalin-ia32.c may work on arm and m68k since it's the
    replacement for stalin-32.c.  We'll find out when the autobuild
    daemons get hold of this.

 -- Rob Browning <rlb@defaultvalue.org>  Sun, 23 Sep 2001 10:58:12 -0500
