Description: Extremely aggressive Scheme compiler
 Stalin is an aggressive self-hosting Scheme compiler, designed to
 generate resource efficient stand-alone executables with very high
 computational performance.  It is a batch mode compiler like gcc, not
 an interpreter, and is designed to be used only after your code has
 stabilized.
 .
 It places a few limitations on the content of the source code.  For
 example, you may not LOAD or EVAL new expressions or procedure
 definitions at runtime, but in exchange, it is able to perform
 various global analyses which may allow it to transparently map
 Scheme types to C types and to use native C arithmetic operations on
 a per-expression basis, whenever such operations are proven safe.
 Further stalin can often reduce or eliminate run-time type checking
 and dispatching, and omit garbage collection for data of limited
 scope or accessibility, while omitting unreachable data altogether.
 .
 Stalin also has a foreign procedure interface to both Xlib and OpenGL.
